# bus-tracker-boston

## Project Description
A real-time bus tracking app that shows the location of MBTA buses in Boston, MA. Made using HTML, CSS and JavaScript and utilizing Mapbox and MBTA API.

## How to Run
View the app on my homepage at https://be-rahn.github.io/ and click the Use the app button. You can also run this project by cloning the repository to your local machine and opening the index.html file in your browser. You will need to obtain an API key from the MBTA API website at https://api-v3.mbta.com/ to run the app.

## Future Improvements
I would like to improve this application by adding more CSS style elements and expanding the app to include more cities.
